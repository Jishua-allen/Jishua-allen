### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://go.qsronline.com/">QSROnline<a/>

<h2>What am I up to now?</h2>
I'm Currently working on a Project rewriting an old web app with new tools and languages. We are still mainly in the design phase and I have been heavily involved in selecting tools and doing some of the initial planning. I am expecting to start working on the project in the next few months.
